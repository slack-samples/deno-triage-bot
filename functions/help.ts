Here’s how :hospital: *Triage Bot* works:
> I look at messages posted in this channel during the last week.
> I only care about messages that have :red_circle:, :large_blue_circle:, or :white_circle:.
> A message with :eyes: reaction is in progress. A message with :white_check_mark: reaction is done. Otherwise, it’s still pending.

What do those emoji mean?
> :red_circle: *Urgent*, needs a response from engineering triage hosts now
> :large_blue_circle: *Not as urgent*, needs a response within the day or needs clarity or direction from the triage hosts
> :white_circle: *Question or clarification*, needs guidance as to next steps
